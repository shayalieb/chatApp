<h3>>Dependencies and libraries that enable this app to properly function</h3>
<ul>
<li>React native: the library that enables this app to work on mobile devices using JSX and JS</li>
<li>@expo/react-native-action-sheet: React Native Action Sheet is a cross-platform React Native component that uses the native UIActionSheet on iOS and a pure JS implementation on Android.</li>
<li>React-native AsyncStorage is simple, asynchronous, and unencrypted by default module that allows you to persist data offline in React Native apps. The persistence of data is done using a key-value storage system. There are numerous scenarios where this module can be beneficial.</li>
<li>React Native netInfo: a cross-platform API that provides access to network information. @react-native-community/netinfo allows you to get information about connection type and connection quality.</li>
<li>React-navigation: navigating between screens on the chatApp</li>
<li>React Native GiftedChat: a pre defined UI for chatting apps that allows for lots of customization, removing the need to code this app from scratch</li>
<li>React Native Screens: provides native primitives to represent screens instead of plain <View> components in order to better take advantage of operating system behavior and optimizations around screens. This capability is used by library authors and unlikely to be used directly by most app developers.</li>
<li>React-native-maps: A predefined set of rules that allows the app to access the users location</li>
<li>React-native-imageicker: A predefined set of rules that allows the app to access the users image library and camera to take pictures within the app</li>
<li>Expo Location: A library that provides access to reading geolocation information, polling current location or subscribing location update events from the device. expo-location allows reading geolocation information from the device. Your app can poll for the current location or subscribe to location update events.</li>
</ul>
